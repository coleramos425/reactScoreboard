# reactScoreboard
This is a scoreboard I've created while learning ReactJS. Thanks to Treehouse for this great introduction to React! Looking forward to some cool future projects using what I've learned from this tutorial!

### Scoreboard Features
* Stopwatch for keeping track of time between moves
* Add/remove players from game
* Keep track of individual scores and overall game statistics
* Dynamic rendering of winning player
